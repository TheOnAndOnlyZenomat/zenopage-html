Alright, I sometimes have a problem with following through with things I have set my mind to, and the possibility's that this will happen with this challenge are not that slim, but I can still try. I mean, if I don't, nothing will change&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But what is this challenge. It is a <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">challenge</a> invented by <a href="https://kevq.uk/">Kev Quirk</a>, to write 100 blog-posts in a year for your personal blog.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to write a blog for some time now, but there was always a distraction (I will come to this in another post) or reason not to. By facing this challenge I want to kind off force myself to finally do it. I love reading blogs from other people, I find it very interesting to read their thoughts and ideas, so why not write one myself, sometimes I also have interesting things to say(^^).
</p>

<p>
The main problem which I fear is not having anything to write about. But this should not be, as particularly mentioned on the website&#x2026; So maybe I can get rid of it, but that will show in the future.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The point of #100DaysToOffload is to be a relaxing and cathartic experience. Not a worrisome affair where youâ€™re thinking of things to write all the time.
</p>

<p>
So lets go!
